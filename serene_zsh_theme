# In short, read the code.

# for long read:
# This modification takes heavy usage of tools provided
# in base theme kennethreitz which I have tried to reverse
# engineer and understand to modify it to fit atleast with my purposes.
# I needed the modification to simultaneously see whole path from 
# home and just the exact directory. It is also nice to know which 
# user @ hostname you are using especially if you know you'll use
# the same configuration in multiple machines or VM's and at times need
# to check which machine is in window you are modifying. Or when you enter 
# a git repo, you'll immidiately get notified what is the state of the repo 


# But anyways, idk, install:
# I have it in my .dotfiles repo in:
# .dotfiles/system/base/shells/oh-my-zsh/custom/themes

# you can try to add it as you see fit on local machine or
# your inside your own .dotfiles ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
